# RNA Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).
Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).
The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:
  - G -> C
  - C -> G
  - T -> A
  - A -> U
